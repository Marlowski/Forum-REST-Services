##Default config file structur
Tokens used in testing, need to be newly generated if not using default used testing token 'abcd'.
Also an own certificate is required. place certificationes in /certificates.
<br/>config/default.json
```json
{
  "session": {
    "tokenKey": "TOKENKEY",
    "timeout": 300
  },
  "db": {
    "connectionString": "DB_LOCATION_URL",
    "dbConfigOptions": {
      "useNewUrlParser": true,
      "useUnifiedTopology": true
    }
  },
  "defaultAdmin": {
    "userID": "1",
    "password": "password",
    "username": "admin-user",

##General (tokens)
There are 3 default tokens used in various test files,
that were generated in the past and are now reused for testing
purposes. Of course can the tester generate new tokens but is then forced
to refactor all test files, if he wants to use those freshly generated
tokens in later tests as well.

###the admin token: 
```sh
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VyIjoiMSIsInJvbGUiOiJhZG1pbiIsImlhdCI6MTYyMTE3NDQxMywiZXhwIjoxNjIyNzk1ODg3NTE5fQ.M-Rm9DUUIs_PzgVEV1ICDOOasVFjIgAezhSsHy6FWSk
```

###the user with the *'registered* status' token: 
```sh
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VyIjoiMiIsInJvbGUiOiJyZWdpc3RlcmVkIiwiaWF0IjoxNjIxMTc0MjMwLCJleHAiOjE2MjI3OTU3MDUxMDh9.xuJ2VaBLSN11U2Jaaezn0ABWFoYnRScBO5uWN4sPPVo
```

###the normal verified user token:
```sh
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VyIjoiMiIsInJvbGUiOiJ1c2VyIiwiaWF0IjoxNjIxMjAyMjc0LCJleHAiOjE2MjI4MjM3NzY4NDJ9.exmgjYmcObyDuzd0LDS_d_yXqkAJBNxg06-vv-14KjM
```

They can just be leaved there if the server database isnt altered further as expected in the test cases.
The Base64 encoded login data is also ready to use, as long as the admin is succesfully saved with userId: 1 and
the user is saved as userId: 2, which should be the normal case.

Therefor most of the tests can be run immediately, if this is not the case its always stated with a note
beforehand.

##Basic testing
####In the following section the different test file requirements and purposes are explained in detail:
**********
###[admin.http](admin.http)
* **manually create user as admin**
* **manually delete user as admin**

*************
###[register.http](register.http)
* **register new Account**
<br/>Its important to <span style="color: red">paste a real email adress here</span> to receive the validation email,
but can also be left like that, since the validation code is logged and can be copied from the console
```json
{
  "username": "uniqueName",
  "email": "marlonkerth@icloud.com",
  "password": "password"
}
```
* **resend verification**
<br/>If the account is still *role: **registered*** a new verification 
  mail can be send
  ####
* **verify account**
<br/><span style="color: red">paste the generated mailtoken here</span>
```http request
[...] verify?mailtoken=KD9jAE7MyshglpsuJbIb
```

*********
###[user.http](user.http)
* **login (here with admin account)**
Even though this is the user file and not the admin file, the admin token is
used, since this account doesnt need to be added manually
```http request
Authorization: Basic MTpwYXNzd29yZA==
decoded version:
Authorization: Basic 1:password
```
* **list all users**
  ####
* **change password**
<br/>recommended to change back the password to the default version
  *'password'* again, if planed to use the current database set for other
  tests aswell
  ####
* **check profil**
<br/>currently set that the user checks his own profil, since no userID is passed
  <br/>to check a different profil for example:
```http request
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "userID": "1"
}
```

*********
###[message.http](message.http)
* **send message to user**
<br/>Send a private message to a user. Since by default the user passed an
  email adress when registering, he will get an email notification including
  the message.

  "text": "message content"
}
```

  and paste it with the action *'read'*

  ```
####
* **delete a specific message**
<br/>delete a specific message almost in the same manner as reading one.
  But instead of passing *'read'* as argument for action, here *'delete'* gets passed.
